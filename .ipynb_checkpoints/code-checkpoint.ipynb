    "1. I am going to use a dictionary to store the player name and scores. \n",
    "2. I will make name as keys and scores as values, it is because names of players(userID) will always be unique while scores can be same.\n",
    "3. Then I will be putting the names and scores in their specific lists so that we can perform operations easily.(to be used in step 6)\n",
    "4. Now for making combinations of M vs M , I will be first make combinations of M players from all existing players.\n",
    "5. After that I will figure out the unique pairs of M vs M matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "After successfully forming M vs M unique matches now I will sort out the matches based on their scores:-\n",
    "\n",
    "6. For this I will perform the operations on the lists created in step 3. \n",
    "7. First I will find the average scores all the combinations of M players that were made in step 4.\n",
    "8. Then based on unique matches of step4 , I will be find the difference between the scores of each M vs M matches.\n",
    "9. Then at last I will sort the matches according to their least scores differences.\n"
